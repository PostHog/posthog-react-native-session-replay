# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository. This will guide you through the process of adding a changeset.

Changesets are markdown files that describe the changes you've made. They are used to generate the changelog and determine the version bump.

## Release process

1. Create a PR with your changes
2. Add a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` 
3. Add the `release` label to your PR
4. When the PR is merged, the release workflow will automatically:
   - Request approval from maintainers (notified via Slack)
   - Once approved, bump the version based on changesets
   - Publish to NPM
   - Create a GitHub release
